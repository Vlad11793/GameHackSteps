1) Attach to a process
-Loop through process list until encounter process you need
-Once process located, you can "OPEN IT" by setting process access rights to PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS meaninig we canm Read/Write to process memory 
Need to open it by using a function called OpenProcess();

ie. HANDLE WINAPI OpenProcess(
	_In_ DWORD dwDesiredAccess,
	_In_ BOOL bInheritHandle.
	_In_ DWORD dwProcessId
    );

2) Reading and Writing Memory: 

	BOOL WINAPI ReadProcessMemory(
	_In_ HANDLE hProcess,
	_In_ LPCVOID lpBaseAddress,
	_Out_ LPVOID lpBuffer,
	_In_ SIZE_T nSize,
	_Out_SIZE_T *lpNumberOfBytesRead
	
    );

	BOOL WINAPI WriteProcessMemory(
	_In_ HANDLE hProcess,
	_In_ LPCVOID lpBaseAddress,
	_Out_ LPVOID lpBuffer,
	_In_ SIZE_T nSize,
	_Out_SIZE_T *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
	
    );

Each parameter returns a BOOL to show if succesful or not.

3) Memory Addresses
-Addresses for memory (duh)
-Hex
eg. 0x123ABC (0x lets compiler know its hex vaule)


4) Use cheat engine to extract memory addresses of .exe's
